          As each day of the war passes, more people in Ukraine are forced to leave their homes and continue to struggle with finding food,

          We are a group of employees who work in Ingelheim, Germany. We have joined our forces since April 2022 to volunteer and actively
          support people in Ukraine affected by the russian invasion. We have friends and family members in Ukraine so we know very well
          what is needed. We collaborate and support volunteers who deliver aid directly to people in need.
