# Welcome to the Simple Donation Website contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! :sparkles:. 

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR..

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

Also, right now we're still busy to get the version one into shape. So documentation is still written...

If you want to contribute already:

- be sure you know GatsbyJS decently (the SSR is not too complicated but needs to be considered)
- you should be able to understand English and German (for now) - to make sure that the content is always up to date in both languages
